The path where the file process_data_cogBST needs to be added in matlab (Home -> Set Path -> Add folder).
### Preprocessing
Before starting the script you need to:
  - Importing patient's MRI into brainstorm
  - Right click on the patient MRI and select "MRI segmentation" and use CAT12 (warning this process takes time)
  - In the excel file generated by ICEM (seeg coordinates), copy the first 4 column and save them in a .txt file

### Processing
Usage:
``` [values,coordinates] = process_data_cogBST ``` 

The first step is to provide the information in the window (see screenshot below):
