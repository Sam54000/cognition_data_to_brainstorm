# Processing data cognition into brainstorm

To process P1, P2 and P3 at the same time use:
``` process_data_cogBST.m ``` [see tutorial](https://github.com/Sam54000/cognition_data_to_brainstorm/blob/main/README.md#tutorial-for-process_data_cogbstm)

To process P1 or P2 or P3 individually use:
``` convert_letswave_to_brainstorm.m ``` 

The path where the file process_data_cogBST needs to be added in matlab (Home -> Set Path -> Add folder).

## Tutorial for ``` process_data_cogBST.m ``` 
### Preprocessing
Before starting the script you need to:
  - Importing patient's MRI into brainstorm
  - Right click on the patient MRI and select "MRI segmentation" and use CAT12 (warning this process takes time)
  - In the excel file generated by ICEM (seeg coordinates), copy the first 4 column and save them in a .txt file

### Processing
Usage:
write in the command widow
``` [values,coordinates] = process_data_cogBST ``` 

The first step is to provide the information in the window (see screenshot below):

The second step constists to select the three corresponding matrices generated from Letswave: P1, P2 and P3.
Select the file indicated at the top of the explorer window (see screnshot below):

![selection window](/Select_file.png)

The third step constists to select the coordinates file (.txt)

### Output
In  the matlab workspace 2 variables are generated:
  - values: a MxN matrix where M is the number of intracerebral contacts and N the number of experimental states (Here N = 3 for P1, P2 and P3)
  - coordinates: a Mx4 table where M is the number of intracerebral contacts. The first column is the name of the intracerebral contact and the three others are the coordinates       X,Y and Z
